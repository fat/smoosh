SMOOOOSH
=========
How would you smoosh a lion and a tiger? A tialiganer, right?

SMOOSH is a tool for packaging your CSS & JavaScript projects. It will lint your JavaScript with [JSHint](http://jshint.com), then build and minify your files (if you'd like) with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) for JavaScript, and [Sqwish](https://github.com/ded/sqwish) for CSS.

Smoosh is available as an npm package. To install, run the following command:

    $ npm install smoosh

CONFIG
======
Currently, smoosh requires a config.json file to work. Your config file should look something like this (check the examples folder for a working example):

    {
      "VERSION": "0.1", // optional
      "JSHINT_OPTS": { ... }
      "JAVASCRIPT": {
        "DIST_DIR": "dist", // optional
        "base": [ ... ],
        "secondary": [ ... ]
      },
      "CSS": {
        "core": [ ... ]
      }
    }

Your config options include:

  * VERSION: an optional version number which will be appended to your built files
  * JAVASCRIPT|CSS:
  * key: the name of your compiled file (ie: 'mootools-core', 'base-bundle', etc.)
  * value: an array of file paths to be bundled (ie. <code>['./src/drag.js', './src/drop.js']</code>)
  + DIST_DIR: the directory to output your files to (if no directory is specified, 'dist' will be used)
  + JSHINT_OPTS: the options to use if running jshint

USING SMOOSH WITH TERMINAL
==========================

once installed with npm, smoosh can be accessed easily from the command line! Just create your config file (shown above), then run commands. Here's a list of some of them:


    //any of these commands will execute all smoosh tasks with config.json
    $ smoosh ./config.json
    $ smoosh make ./config.json
    $ smoosh -m ./config.json

    //executing either of these commands will destroy the dist folder
    $ smoosh clean ./config.json
    $ smoosh -d ./config.json

    //these will generate ugliyjs minified versions of your packaged source
    $ smoosh compressed ./config.json
    $ smoosh -c ./config.json

    //these will generate full, uncompressed version of your packaged source
    $ smoosh uncompressed
    $ smoosh -f ./config.json

    //executing either of these commands will build both compressed and uncompressed versions of your source
    $ smoosh build ./config.json
    $ smoosh -b ./config.json

    //these will run jshint against your uncompressed source
    $ smoosh run ./config.json
    $ smoosh -r ./config.json

    //the -a flag will run analyze.. you must include a build type for analyze to work
    $ smoosh -ca ./config
    $ smoosh -ba ./config
    $ smoosh -fa ./config

    //as you might have guessed, you can specify multiple flags at the same time
    $ smoosh -dba ./config //<-- this will clean the dist folder, build new files, and then analyze them


USING SMOOSH WITH THE CODEZ
===========================

once installed, smoosh is pretty easy to use...

``` js
var smoosh = require('smoosh');
```

Once required there are several methods available to you:

<code>config</code>
------
As stated above, smoosh requires that you pass it the path to your configuration json file. To do that, you would do:

``` js
smoosh.config('./config.json')
```

<code>clean</code>
-----
The clean method will remove your distribution directory. **Warning** This will empty your entire DIST directory. So this may be unwanted behavior if your DIST directory is "./". It is preferred that this is only used when you have a dedicated dist folder. Eg: "./src/build" or "./dist"

``` js
smoosh.clean();
```

<code>run</code>
---
Run takes one argument; a string which specifies what to run. Currently run only works with jslint, therefore you can do either:

``` js
smoosh.run('jslint');
//or
smoosh.run();
```

In the future we may add more useful things here.

<code>build</code>
-----
Build is used to build your sources together. You can build uncompressed or compressed files or both! You can use it like this:

``` js
smoosh.build('uncompressed');
//or
smoosh.build('compressed');
//or
smoosh.build() // <-- this will build both compressed and uncompressed
```

<code>analyze</code>
-------
Analyze is useful when you're curious if you're making your files larger or smaller. It will return relevant file size for uncompressed, compressed, or gzipped files.

``` js
smoosh.analyze('uncompressed');
//or
smoosh.analyze('compressed');
//or
smoosh.analyze('gzipped'); //it gzips the compressed files only
//or
smoosh.analyze(); //which will do analyze all types
```

<code>done</code>
-------
Done is used to execute a callback at a certain point in the smoosh command chain. Typically, it is used at the end of the chain when smoosh has completed, but it can also be added between steps.

``` js
smoosh.config('smoosh.json').clean().run().build.done(function() {
  console.log('Smoosh is finished!');
});
```

<code>make</code>
----
Make can currently be used as a shortcut to run all smoosh methods... It requires one argument, the path to the config file.json.

``` js
smoosh.make('./config.json');

//is the same as
smoosh.config('./config.json').run().build().analyze();
```

**Happy Smooshing!**
